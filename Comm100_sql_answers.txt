
1. Find the books which don’t have the word ‘happy’ in the names

	SELECT * 
	FROM Books 
	WHERE Name NOT LIKE '%happy%';

2. Delete all the data (approx. 5 million) in the Books table

	TRUNCATE BOOKS;

3. Find all the authors who are not winners – please provide 3 different ways and state which one is the best

	i. SELECT a.*
		FROM Author a
		LEFT JOIN Winners w ON a.Id = w.WinnerAuthorId
		WHERE w.WinnerAuthorId IS NULL;
		
	ii. SELECT a.*
			FROM Author a
			LEFT JOIN Winners w ON a.Id = w.WinnerAuthorId
			WHERE w.WinnerAuthorId IS NULL;
			
	iii. SELECT *
			FROM Author a
			WHERE NOT EXISTS (
				SELECT 1
				FROM Winners w
				WHERE a.Id = w.WinnerAuthorId
			);

4. Which one is the best?

	The performance of these queries can depend on the database system and the size of the tables. However, typically
	'NOT EXISTS' (3rd one) is often preferred for its readability and efficiency with indexed columns.
